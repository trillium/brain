# Claude Code Entry Point for Beads

This file is intentionally short. Do not copy workflow, build, storage, or UI
rules here; those details drift quickly when repeated across agent entrypoints.

## Read First

- **Workflow and safety**: [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)
- **Detailed agent operations**: [AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md](AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md)
- **Architecture orientation**: [docs/CLAUDE.md](docs/CLAUDE.md)
- **PR maintenance policy**: [PR_MAINTAINER_GUIDELINES.md](PR_MAINTAINER_GUIDELINES.md)

## Current Ground Rules

- Run `bd prime` before doing tracked work.
- Follow `go.mod` and [AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md](AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md) for build
  and test commands; do not hard-code toolchain versions here.
- Beads uses Dolt as the issue database. Use `bd dolt push` / `bd dolt pull`
  for issue data sync; do not use export/import as a routine git workflow.
- The CLI Visual Design System lives in
  [AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md](AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md#visual-design-system).
- If this file conflicts with a linked source, trust the linked source and fix
  this file by removing the duplicate.

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

**Architecture in one line:** issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on your git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. See https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/SYNC_CONCEPTS.md for details and anti-patterns.

## Agent Context Profiles

The managed Beads block is task-tracking guidance, not permission to override repository, user, or orchestrator instructions.

- **Conservative (default)**: Use `bd` for task tracking. Do not run git commits, git pushes, or Dolt remote sync unless explicitly asked. At handoff, report changed files, validation, and suggested next commands.
- **Minimal**: Keep tool instruction files as pointers to `bd prime`; use the same conservative git policy unless active instructions say otherwise.
- **Team-maintainer**: Only when the repository explicitly opts in, agents may close beads, run quality gates, commit, and push as part of session close. A current "do not commit" or "do not push" instruction still wins.

## Session Completion

This protocol applies when ending a Beads implementation workflow. It is subordinate to explicit user, repository, and orchestrator instructions.

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create beads for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **Handle git/sync by active profile**:
   ```bash
   # Conservative/minimal/default: report status and proposed commands; wait for approval.
   git status

   # Team-maintainer opt-in only, unless current instructions forbid it:
   git pull --rebase
   git push
   git status
   ```
5. **Hand off** - Summarize changes, validation, issue status, and any blocked sync/commit/push step

**Critical rules:**
- Explicit user or orchestrator instructions override this Beads block.
- Do not commit or push without clear authority from the active profile or the current user request.
- If a required sync or push is blocked, stop and report the exact command and error.
